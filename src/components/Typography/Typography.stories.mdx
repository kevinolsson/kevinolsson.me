# Typography

**Major Third (5/4)** musical Interval is used as ratio paired with a Base font size of 18px.
Body type follows a lineheight multiplier of 1.6, while the headers follow a multiplier of 1.2

**Font-size** is computed by multiplying the Major Third (1.25) by itself X number of times
and then multiplying the product by the base font size of 18px.
X is any value where the final font-size returns a desireable result.

**Line-height** is computed by multiplying the font-size with the respective multipler,
then getting the highest available number divisible by 4. (x % 4 === 0)
