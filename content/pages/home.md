# Barebones Netlify CMS + React Starter

Do note that this is a stripped down and modified version of [Jinksi/Netlify CMS + React Starter](https://github.com/Jinksi/netlify-cms-react-starter)- Do check his [Jinksi](https://github.com/Jinksi/)'s repo out as he explains everything in a much better fashion.

Barebone starter point for creating JAMstack sites with Netlify CMS. Ideal for someone who is:

* Accustomed to working with create-react-app
* Not interested in dealing with Gatsby or Preact

## [](https://github.com/kevinolsson/barebones-netlify-cms-react-starter#so-how-does-this-repo-differ)So how does this repo differ?

* Stripped down to almost nothing. Sometimes when starting a new project, you just want the bare minimum. This repo aims to achieve that.
* Modified to use ContextProviders for accessing data. There are a few examples in the components I've created.
* Probably am not following best-practices. Then again, there's barely anything there.
* The admin end of this repo has no preview at the moment. That means that when writing posts / pages, you will get an unstructured and unstyled output as your preview instead of something nice.

## [](https://github.com/kevinolsson/barebones-netlify-cms-react-starter#todo)Todo

* Rewrite some of Jinksis component to into functional components.
* Further remove dependencies that I don't need / can be achieved with my own code.
* Preview for your pages and post.
