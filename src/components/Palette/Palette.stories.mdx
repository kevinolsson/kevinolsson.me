# Palette

Using MaterialUI gives me access to a lot of palettes which I don't necessarily need.
So I've placed all the colors I'm using in its own palette group `theme.palette.portfolio.<color>`
and will be accessing these colors when I need them.

This way, I won't have to worry about having to define (or overwrite) each default MaterialUI palette
when I start building on top of some of their components.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Portfolio">
    <Palette />
  </Story>
</Preview>

I've deliberately left out the MaterialUI palettes in the preview as they are not really relevant.
