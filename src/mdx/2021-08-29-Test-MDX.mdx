# Hello World
## I created this using a .mdx file

This allows me to to blend markup with and JSX:

<div style={{ 
    border: `1px solid ${theme.palette.portfolio.altGrey}`,
    padding: theme.spacing(8),
    borderRadius: theme.shape.borderRadius
  }}>
  <ExperienceBlock 
    avatar={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/images/pamind.jpg`}
    company="Påmind AB"
    position="Front-end developer"
    details={["Stockhom, Sweden", "May 2019 - August 2021"]}
  >
    <ul>
      <li>
        Developing Påmind's front-end applications using React, Redux, and Redux
        Saga. Hello World
      </li>
      <li>Writing tests using Jest and Enzyme</li>
      <li>
        Crafting UI components and molding the design system using Storybook.js
        &amp; Material UI
      </li>
      <li>Architected Påmind's new "Supplier Web" application</li>
    </ul>
  </ExperienceBlock>
</div>

As of writing (2021-08-30) I am currently mapping each MDX to a string (that matches their filename) and use that to load the component, but in the future I would ideally like to dynamically import the MDX files. Still haven't figured out how to do that as of writing.
