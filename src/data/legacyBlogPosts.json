    "content": "So I finally got around to building myself website. It's funny since I build websites for a living.\n\nA good friend of mine always loved comparing a web developer who doesn't have a website to a mechanic who drives around with a shitty car. *\"He's probably too busy taking care of other people's car to put time into his own.\"* \n\nSame friend also always encouraged me to write a bit more. I figured it was finally time to do that.\n\n\n\n## Why decide to build a blog now?\n\nI guess the first and most important reason is that **I just need to write more**. Specifically write more about what I dabble with. Writing (and to some extent, expressing myself) is something I am **not** particularly good at and the only way to not suck is to just write more. \n\nAlso, I'm hoping that it would **rekindle my curiosity for learning**. I learnt React and Redux around a year ago (early 2019) and outside of a few libraries I haven't really been learning anything new. I want to fix that.\n\nAnother reason is that **I need an outlet for building fun things and then talking about it.** For the most part, I would like to be coding a lot more outside of work, and on a less professional level. \n\nLastly, **I'm bored.** I built this blog during the COVID-19 epidemic and I acknowledge how privileged I am that my biggest issue is that I have nothing better to do other than build myself a website. In my defense, I've been procrastinating this site since December so It was only right I followed through with it. I guess that's another reason you can put on the list, **I'm just seeing through something that I've started.**\n\nI'm using the term website and blog interchangeably btw.\n\n\n\n## This site is built with love and:\n\n* JavaScript + React\n* NetlifyCMS\n* MaterialUI\n* Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n#### **JavaScript + React.**\n\nNo surprise really. I am a front-end developer. React is my go to. I actually had only gotten back to being a front-end developer less than 12 months ago, and before that I was working professionally as a UX designer. It feels great to be programming again! Also yes, I do have ambitions of moving into TypeScript.\n\nI'm using the [Barebones Netlify CMS + React Starter](https://github.com/kevinolsson/barebones-netlify-cms-react-starter). That link leads to a repo on my GitHub profile though its fair to say that its a starter heavily modified from [Jinksi](https://github.com/Jinksi/netlify-cms-react-starter). The reason for the starter is that when I work on new projects, I just want a blank canvass with all the tools I'm going to be working with already humming under the hood. It's a bit messy and It needs a lot of work. I'm looking to outright redoing the whole thing with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + adding a few other things.\n\n\n\n#### **NetlifyCMS + Netlify**\n\nI figured building this site was also a good excuse to learn something new. While I could have easily just written all my posts on Markdown and read from that directly, I was very interested in working with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). I had worked a lot with WordPress back in the day, and I wanted something that was more inline with the technology I worked with with today. It was a good excuse to get started.\n\nNetlifyCMS does not have a starter with *just* React (ala create-react-app). I wasn't exactly interested in dealing with Gatsby or Preact right now hence another reason for the starter I mentioned above.\n\n**[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is just ‚ù§Ô∏è** I have nothing else to write about them.\n\n\n\n#### **Material UI**\n\nI love this [React UI framework](https://material-ui.com/). While I built most of my own UI components, its just comforting to know that I can pull ready to use components if I had gotten lazy. I was relying namely on their createMuiTheme and makeStyle functions as they're super convenient.\n\n**There were a lot of other tools, libraries and tricks I used building this blog. They're not really relevant at the moment but I will be writing about them in future blog posts!**\n\n\n\n## Future posts\n\nAs mentioned, I already have a few things lined up for future blog posts. The ambition is to try to have a new blog post up every week, just so that I get into the habit of writing.\n\n#### Do I expect people to be reading all of this?\n\nNope. üí©\n\nBut do be on the look out for posts regarding StorybookJS, a discussion on privacy policies, modular scale + vertical rhythm and a lot of other good stuff!",
