import { Counter } from "components/Counter/Counter";
import { Button } from "components/Button/Button";
import { theme } from 'Theme';
import logo from "logo.svg";

## I created this using a .mdx file

This allows me to to blend markup with and JSX:

<div style={{ 
    border: `1px solid ${theme.palette.portfolio.altGrey}`,
    padding: theme.spacing(8),
    borderRadius: theme.shape.borderRadius,
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    alignItems: "center"
  }}>
  <img src={logo}
    style={{
      height: "40vmin",
      pointerEvents: "none"
    }}
    alt="logo" />
  <Counter />
</div>

As of writing (2021-08-30) I am currently mapping each MDX to a string (that matches their filename) and use that to load the component, but in the future I would ideally like to dynamically import the MDX files. Still haven't figured out how to do that as of writing.
