# Layout

Any component wrapped inside the `Layout` component will have a specific set of CSS styles applied to it.
This is so that every component wrapped inside will have consistent top level layout related stylings.

Refer to `Layout.js` to check out said styles.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default">
      <Layout>
        <Typography variant="h1" gutterBottom>Hello World</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">I never really know what to write after Hello World.</Typography>
      </Layout>
  </Story>
</Preview>


## Props
<Props of={Layout} />
