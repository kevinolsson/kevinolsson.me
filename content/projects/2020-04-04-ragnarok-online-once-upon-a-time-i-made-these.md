# Let me tell you a story

It was *2010*. I was in high school. I enjoyed playing this game called *Ragnarok Online*. I enjoyed it so much that I started designing and coding up websites for various *Private Ragnarok Online Servers*. This is where I started designing. This is where I started dabbling with web development in a professional capacity. This is also how a 16 year old high school student made cash! ðŸ˜…

Responsive websites were not a thing back then. Heck back then you couldn't even use custom fonts! I had to use flash to produce a lot of the fonts seen in the design (mixed with smart usage of images).

Front-end development was more straightforward back then. There were no plethora of Javascript Libraries to work with (jQuery was a thing, but having JS in websites was not a requirement). No CSS preprocessors. Nothing. Just good old CSS and HTML.

Back then I wasn't exactly designing to "solve a problem" but really just designing to make things look pretty. It's always a joy to revisit work you did many years ago and say "Hey, these still look pretty good!" while at the same time realise how much you've grown as a designer.
